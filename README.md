# 📂 Data Analyst vs. Software Engineer Salary Comparison
This project tests whether Data Analysts and Software Engineers at [Company XYZ] (or your dataset’s source) earn the same average salary. It combines Python statistical analysis and a clear Power BI dashboard to communicate the results.

## ✅ Project Goal
To answer a practical, real-world question:

Are Data Analysts and Software Engineers paid equally on average, or is there a significant pay gap?

## 📈 What’s Included
### 🗂️ Notebook (Python)
Clean and filter salary data

Calculate summary statistics (mean, std dev)

Visualize pay distributions with boxplots and histograms

Run Levene’s test for equal variances

Run a Welch’s t-test to compare means

Interpret the result in plain language

### 📊 Power BI Dashboard
Visual breakdown: average salaries by role

Boxplot or to show spread and outliers

Summary text block highlighting key finding and statistical result

### 🔬 Key Finding
The Welch’s t-test returned a test statistic of 21.2 and a p-value near 0, indicating extremely strong evidence that average salaries differ between the two roles.
Data Scientists earn significantly more on average than Software Engineers in this dataset.

### 📌 Tools Used
Python (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, scipy.stats)

Jupyter Notebook

Power BI for dashboarding
